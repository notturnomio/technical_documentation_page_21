                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">SVG</a> is an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML">XML</a> language, similar to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/XHTML">XHTML</a>,
                which can be used to draw vector graphics, such as the ones shown to the right. It can be used to create an image either by specifying all the lines and shapes necessary, by modifying already existing raster images, or by a combination
                of both. The image and its components can also be transformed, composited together, or filtered to change their appearance completely.</p>

            <p>SVG came about in 1999 after several competing formats had been submitted to the <a href="https://www.w3.org" class="external" rel=" noopener">W3C</a> and failed to be fully ratified. SVG is supported by all major <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=svg"
                    class="external" rel=" noopener">browsers</a>. A downside is loading SVG can be slow. SVG does offer benefits, some of which include having a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">DOM interface</a> available for it,
                and not requiring third-party extensions. Whether or not to use it often depends on your specific use case.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="basic_ingredients">
            <header class="article-header">Basic ingredients</header>
            <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a> provides elements for defining headers, paragraphs, tables, and so on. In much the same way SVG provides elements for circles, rectangles, and simple and complex curves.
                A simple SVG document consists of nothing more than the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/svg"><code>&lt;svg&gt;</code></a> root element and several basic shapes that build a graphic together. In addition
                there is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/g"><code>&lt;g&gt;</code></a> element, which is used to group several basic shapes together.</p>

            <p>Starting from there, the SVG image can become arbitrarily complex. SVG supports gradients, rotations, filter effects, animations, interactivity with JavaScript, and so on. But all these extra features of the language rely on this relatively
                small set of elements to define the graphics area.</p>

            <header class="article-header">Before you start</header>
            <p>There are a number of drawing applications available such as <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/" class="external" rel=" noopener">Inkscape</a> which are free and use SVG as their native file format. However, this tutorial will rely on the trusty
                XML or text editor (your choice). The idea is to teach the internals of SVG to those who want to understand it, and that is best done by dirtying your hands with a bit of markup. You should note your final goal though. Not all SVG viewers
                are equal and so there is a good chance that something written for one app will not display exactly the same in another, because they support different levels of the SVG specification or another specification that you are using along with
                SVG (that is, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a>).</p>

            <p>SVG is supported in all modern browsers and even a couple versions back in some cases. A fairly complete browser support table can be found on <a href="https://caniuse.com/svg" class="external" rel=" noopener">Can I use</a>. Firefox has supported
                some SVG content since version 1.5, and that support level has been growing with each release since. Hopefully, along with the tutorial here, MDN can help developers keep up with the differences between Gecko and some of the other major
                implementations.
            </p>

            <p>Before starting you should have a basic understanding of XML or another markup language such as HTML. If you are not too familiar with XML, here are some guidelines to keep in mind: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>SVG elements and attributes should all be entered in the case shown here since XML is case-sensitive (unlike HTML).</li>
                <li>Attribute values in SVG must be placed inside quotes, even if they are numbers.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>SVG is a huge specification. This tutorial attempts to cover the basics. Once you are familiar you should be able to use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element">Element Reference</a> and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model#svg_interfaces">Interface Reference</a>                to find out anything else you need to know.</p>

            <header class="article-header">Flavors of SVG</header>
            <p>Since becoming a recommendation in 2003, the most recent "full" SVG version is 1.1. It builds on top of SVG 1.0, but adds more modularization to ease implementation. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/" class="external" rel=" noopener">The second edition of SVG 1.1</a>                became a Recommendation in 2011. "Full" SVG 1.2 was meant to be the next major release of SVG. It was dropped for the upcoming <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/" class="external" rel=" noopener">SVG 2.0</a>, which is under heavy development
                right now and follows a similar approach to CSS 3 in that it splits components into several loosely coupled specifications.</p>

            <p>Apart from the full SVG recommendations, the working group at the W3C introduced SVG Tiny and SVG Basic in 2003. These two profiles are aimed mainly at mobile devices. The first, SVG Tiny, should yield graphics primitives for small devices
                with low capabilities. SVG Basic offers many features of full SVG, but doesn't include the ones which are hard to implement or heavy to render (like animations). In 2008, SVG Tiny 1.2 became a W3C Recommendation.</p>

            <p>There were plans for an SVG Print specification, which would add support for multiple pages and enhanced color management. This work was discontinued.</p>

            <header class="article-header">A simple example</header>
            <p>Let us dive straight in with a simple example. Take a look at the following code.</p>
            <pre class="brush: xml notranslate"><code>&lt;svg version="1.1"
                baseProfile="full"
                width="300" height="200"
                xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
           
             &lt;rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="red" /&gt;
           
             &lt;circle cx="150" cy="100" r="80" fill="green" /&gt;
           
             &lt;text x="150" y="125" font-size="60" text-anchor="middle" fill="white"&gt;SVG&lt;/text&gt;
           
           &lt;/svg&gt;
           </code></pre>
            <p>Copy the code and paste it in a file demo1.svg. Then open the file in Firefox. It will render as shown in the following screenshot. (Firefox users: click <a href="https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2012/07/09/3075/89b1e0a26e8421e19f907e0522b188bd/svgdemo1.xml"
                    class="external" rel=" noopener">here</a>)</p>

            <p>The rendering process involves the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>We start with the <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> root element:
                    <ul>
                        <li>a doctype declaration as known from (X)HTML should be left off because DTD based SVG validation leads to more problems than it solves.</li>
                        <li>before SVG 2, to identify the version of the SVG for other types of validation the <code>version</code> and <code>baseProfile</code> attributes should always be used instead. Both <code>version</code> and <code>baseProfile</code>                            attributes are deprecated in SVG 2.</li>
                        <li>as an XML dialect, SVG must always bind the namespaces correctly (in the xmlns attribute). <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Namespaces_Crash_Course">Namespaces Crash Course</a> page for more info.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The background is set to red by drawing a rectangle <code>&lt;rect&gt;</code> that covers the complete image area.</li>
                <li>A green circle <code>&lt;circle&gt;</code> with a radius of 80px is drawn atop the center of the red rectangle (center of circle offset 150px to the right, and 100px downward from the top left corner).</li>
                <li> The text "SVG" is drawn. The interior of each letter is filled in with white. The text is positioned by setting an anchor where we want the midpoint to be: in this case, the midpoint should correspond to the center of the green circle.
                    Fine adjustments can be made to the font size and vertical position to ensure the final result is aesthetically pleasing.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The first important thing to notice is the order of rendering elements. The globally valid rule for SVG files is, that <em>later</em> elements are rendered <em>atop previous</em> elements. The further down an element is the more it
                        will be visible.</li>
                    <li>SVG files on the web can be displayed directly in the browser or embedded in HTML files via several methods:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the HTML is XHTML and is delivered as type <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>, the SVG can be directly embedded in the XML source.</li>
                            <li>If the HTML is HTML5, and the browser is a conforming HTML5 browser, the SVG can also be directly embedded. However, there may be syntax changes necessary to conform to the HTML5 specification.</li>
                            <li>The SVG file can be referenced with an <code>object</code> element:
                                <pre class="notranslate">        &lt;object data="image.svg" type="image/svg+xml" /&gt;</pre></li>
                            <li>Likewise an <code>iframe</code> element can be used:
                                <pre class="notranslate">        &lt;iframe src="image.svg"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</pre></li>
                            <li>An <code>img</code> element can theoretically be used too. However, this technique doesn't work in Firefox before 4.0.</li>
                            <li>Finally, SVG can be created dynamically with JavaScript and injected into the HTML DOM. With this method, replacement technologies can be implemented for browsers which normally can't process SVG.</li>
                        </ul>

            <header class="article-header">SVG file types</header>
            <p>SVG files come in two flavors. Normal SVG files are simple text files containing SVG markup. The recommended filename extension for these files is ".svg" (all lowercase).</p>
            <p>Due to the potentially massive size SVG files can reach when used for some applications (e.g., geographical applications), the SVG specification also allows for gzip-compressed SVG files. The recommended filename extension for these files
                is ".svgz" (all lowercase). Unfortunately, it is very problematic to get gzip-compressed SVG files to work reliably across all SVG capable user agents when served from a Microsoft IIS server, and Firefox cannot load gzip-compressed SVG
                from the local computer. Avoid gzip-compressed SVG except when you are publishing to a webserver that you know will serve it correctly (see below).</p>

            <header class="article-header">A word on Webservers</header>
            <p>Now that you have an idea of how to create basic SVG files, the next stage is to upload them to a Webserver. There are some gotchas at this stage though. For normal SVG files, servers should send the HTTP headers:</p>

            <pre class="notranslate">Content-Type: image/svg+xml
                Vary: Accept-Encoding</pre>
            <p>For gzip-compressed SVG files, servers should send the HTTP headers:</p>

            <pre class="notranslate">Content-Type: image/svg+xml
                    Content-Encoding: gzip
                    Vary: Accept-Encoding</pre>

            <p>You can check that your server is sending the correct HTTP headers with your SVG files by using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Network_Monitor#headers">Network Monitor panel</a> or a site such as <a href="https://websniffer.cc/"
                    class="external" rel=" noopener">websniffer.cc</a>. Submit the URL of one of your SVG files and look at the HTTP response headers. If you find that your server is not sending the headers with the values given above, then you should contact
                your Web host. If you have problems convincing them to correctly configure their servers for SVG, there may be ways to do it yourself. See the <a href="https://www.w3.org/services/svg-server/" class="external" rel=" noopener">server configuration page</a>                on the w3.org for a range of simple solutions.</p>

            <p>Server misconfiguration is a very common reason for SVG failing to load, so make sure you check yours. If your server is not configured to send the correct headers with the SVG files it serves, then Firefox will most likely show the markup
                of the files as text or encoded garbage, or even ask the viewer to choose an application to open them.</p>
